# IMAN CRUD App: Java GUI Hotel Booking System

This repository contains a Java GUI application for hotel room booking and management, developed as a final requirement for the Information Management (IMAN) subject. It showcases the implementation of a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) system using Java Swing, SQL, and the H2 embedded database. I only had two days to finish the application, and this included learning the tooling behind the NetBeans editor to create a GUI as well as finding an embedded database and learning how to connect to it. As such the application is quite rough on the edges. Nonetheless, it was still a great learning experience.

## Project Overview

The IMAN CRUD App is a comprehensive hotel booking system that allows users to manage lodger information, room details, and reservations. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD operations on three main entities: lodgers, rooms, and reservations.

Key features of the application include:

- **Lodger Management**: Create, update, delete, and view lodger records with details such as name, contact information, and address.
- **Room Management**: Add, modify, remove, and display room information, including room number, tier (e.g., Standard, Deluxe, Executive), capacity, and pricing.
- **Reservation Management**: Make new reservations, edit existing ones, cancel reservations, and view reservation details like check-in/check-out dates, duration, and total amount.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in an H2 embedded database, ensuring data integrity and persistence across application sessions.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Input validation and error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure data consistency and provide user-friendly error messages.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (GUI)
- SQL
- H2 Embedded Database

## Getting Started

To run the IMAN CRUD App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/left-no-crumbz/iman-gui.git)`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Build and run the `Main` class.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with the main window containing three tabs: "Lodger," "Room," and "Registration." Each tab provides a set of functionalities for managing the respective entities.

### Lodger Management

- Click the "Lodger" tab to access the lodger management features.
- Use the provided forms and buttons to create, update, delete, and search for lodger records.

### Room Management

- Navigate to the "Room" tab to manage room information.
- Create new rooms, modify existing room details, remove rooms, and search for specific rooms using the available controls.

### Reservation Management

- Switch to the "Registration" tab to handle reservations.
- Make new reservations by providing the required details, such as check-in/check-out dates, room selection, and mode of payment.
- Edit or cancel existing reservations by searching for the reservation ID and modifying the relevant fields.
